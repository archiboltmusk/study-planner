      "The phrenic nerve (C3, C4, C5 — 'C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive') provides the entire motor supply and central sensory supply to the diaphragm. Peripheral diaphragm sensation is from lower intercostal nerves. [NEET PG 2024]",

      "The ampulla (55%) is the most common site of ectopic pregnancy, followed by the isthmus (25%). Isthmic ectopics rupture earlier (5–6 weeks) as the tube is narrower. Ampullary ectopics typically rupture at 8–12 weeks. Risk factor: PID, previous tubal surgery. [AIIMS 2023]",
